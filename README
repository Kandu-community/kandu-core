# Notes

## API

For client app to authenticate, the token key should be included in the Authorization HTTP header. The key should be prefixed by the string literal "Token", with whitespace separating the two strings. For example:

	Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b

The token may be obtained by POSTing username and password to `/api/get-token/`

API can be explored and tested through web-browser starting at `/api/`.
